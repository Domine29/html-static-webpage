## Add additional responsiveness
1. Background Images change every half second (create a slide show that automatically transitions images)
2. When the Navbar reaches the top of the screen have it 'stick' to the top of the webpage
3. Have the 'Introducting The Box' section texts and image slide and/or appear on the webpage when the user scrolls to that section.
